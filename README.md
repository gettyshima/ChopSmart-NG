# Onu’s Kitchen - Restaurant SaaS

A professional, "White-Label" Restaurant Management System designed for efficiency and elegance.

## Project Overview
This is a Full-Stack web application built with a focus on high-performance UI/UX and scalable "Vanilla" architecture. It allows restaurants to manage their menu, track sales, and streamline the ordering process.

### The Four Pillars (User Roles)
Customer Menu: An interactive, visually appealing menu for browsing and ordering.

Waiter Dashboard: A fast-paced interface featuring PIN-protected login for order management.

Kitchen Display (Chef): A real-time view for chefs to manage incoming tickets and preparation times.

Admin Panel: A data-driven dashboard for sales analytics and menu customization.

## Tech Stack
HTML5: Semantic structure for accessibility and SEO.

CSS3: Custom properties (Variables), Flexbox, and Grid for a responsive, "SaaS" feel.

JavaScript: (Coming Soon) To handle order logic and state management.

Git: Version control and deployment.

## Design Philosophy
Typography: Using Lora for elegance and Serif fallbacks for reliability.

Colors: A sophisticated palette of Charcoal, Burnt Orange, and Clean White.

UX: Large touch targets for waiters/chefs and a "mobile-first" approach for customers.
